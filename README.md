# Project Background
The South Saskatchewan Community Foundation (SSCF) is an organization which connects donors and charities across southern Saskatchewan. They support local charities and provide funding services to develop communities.  Doing this requires a very long, time and resource consuming process of strategy building which is both efficient and makes a large impact on the community. There are multiple charities and non-profit organizations all over Saskatchewan making it difficult to link all of them together to ensure better workflow. Thus, a simple solution to this problem would be a resource hub.  
Our client is [Brooklyn Coulson](https://sscf.ca/our-staff/brooklyn-coulson/) from the SSCF who will be serving both as a guide and advisor througout the length of the project.  
Our goal is to design a destination hub which will provide services such as fundraising, granting, marketing, storytelling, etc. and provides a common platform for charities and non-profit organizations to easily exchange resources. The first step is to identify the business need and target customers. Next, there is a lot of brainstorming and ideas are put together to create affinity maps and user story maps. Based on this, sites maps and some low fidelity prototypes will be made to generate a basic layout of the project.  
In short, our project uses application of the Fast-Feedback cycle to meet the client's needs and build a promising resource hub
