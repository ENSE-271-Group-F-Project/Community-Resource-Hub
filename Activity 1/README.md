## This is PHASE 1 of our design journey

### Using the Fast-Feedback cycle
This activity folder contains the preliminary process od designing a website. Our group got together and brainstormed ideas together based on the client presentation by analyzing the actual problem to be tackled and the need for the website. 
Next, we designed our prototypes by keeping the client's needs in mind and achieving a low-fidelity design for out website.
Then we got in touch with the user to get feedback on the on going process and discussing more in detail about what the client actually wants, thier likes and dislikes, what they might want etc. A summary of this is uploaded in [Meeting Notes](./Meeting%20Notes.pdf).
